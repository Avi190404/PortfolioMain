## The Challenge

At **Ecowoodies**, we relied heavily on automation. However, testing new workflows directly on the production server was risky. One bad node could crash the active lead generation pipeline.

## The Solution

I decided to implement a dual-environment architecture using **AWS Lightsail**.

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
I provisioned two separate Linux instances:
1. **Production (Prod):** Only runs verified, stable workflows.
2. **Quality Assurance (QA):** A sandbox for testing new ideas.

```bash
# Example Docker command I used to spin up the instance
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
 n8nio/n8n
