## The Problem

Managing an E-commerce store often involves "invisible work." For one project, the operations team was manually copying order details from the Shopify dashboard into a master Google Sheet for inventory tracking.

This process consumed **10+ hours per week** and was prone to human error (typos in addresses, wrong SKU numbers).

## The Automation Architecture

Instead of paying for expensive connector tools like Zapier, I architected a custom solution using **Google Apps Script** (GAS) acting as a webhook receiver.

### The Workflow
1.  **Trigger:** Customer places an order on Shopify.
2.  **Webhook:** Shopify sends a JSON payload to my GAS endpoint.
3.  **Processing:** Script parses the JSON to extract Customer Name, SKU, and Price.
4.  **Action:** Appends a new row to the Master Sheet and sends a Telegram alert.

```javascript
// The Google Apps Script that handles the POST request
function doPost(e) {
  const data = JSON.parse(e.postData.contents);
  const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName('Orders');
  
  // Extract key details
  const orderId = data.id;
  const price = data.total_price;
  const customer = data.customer.first_name;

  // Append to Google Sheet instantly
  sheet.appendRow([new Date(), orderId, customer, price]);

  // Send alert to Warehouse Team via Telegram API
  sendTelegramAlert(`New Order #${orderId} from ${customer}`);
  
  return ContentService.createTextOutput("Success");
}
